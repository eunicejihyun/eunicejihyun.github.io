During my last semester of college, I was an introvert on a self-improvement spree. I decided to do things that were outside of my comfort zone so in addition to taking a public speaking class and joining group therapy, I interviewed for a job at a restaurant called Zip Chicken. This was my interview with the owner, Han:

**Han:** Do you have any serving experience?

**Me:** No...

**Han:** Have you tried our chicken before?

**Me:** (internally panicking) Oh, sorry, no.

**Han:** … Well, it’s not a hard job. I’ll see you on Monday.

I was ELATED, but of course personal growth is never easy.

There was this one time when a couple came in for a date. I gave them the best service I could, and it seemed to pay off when the girl gave me the paid check, smiled, and said, “Keep the change.” _What a baller_, I thought.

She left me a 24 cent tip.

To this day, “Keep the change” just sounds sinister.
