One time in my second year of college, I had just missed the city bus at one of those stops along the highway where the bus comes every 20 minutes or so. There happened to be a sign spinner about 100 ft from the bus stop. Although, he was doing the best he could, I think we both knew that his efforts weren’t going to pay off anyway. Who in their right mind would even try to read his sign when they’re going 50 mph and the sign is spinning?

He must’ve gotten really bored because he walked over and started chatting with me. To this day, it is one of the most surreal conversations I have ever had.

A middle-aged man I had never encountered before said he was proud of me for getting a college education. He said that we never know what happens in life, but no matter what I needed to be able to protect myself by working and accumulating some level of wealth.

He wasn’t saying that he had high expectations for me or that he saw great potential in me. He was telling me to hustle so that I could be independent and support myself. It was both enlightening and empowering.

Regardless of ability and potential, **you can and you should for yourself.**
