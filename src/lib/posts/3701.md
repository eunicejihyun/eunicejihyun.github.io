Listening to <NewTabLink link="https://youtube.com/embed/d9IxdwEFk1c" text="Palette" /> right now. It really captures the essence of being twenty-five, and let me just say, “I like it.”

IU sings about the things she likes at twenty-five – buttoned pajamas, lipstick, short hair, her palette, diaries, and the times she fell asleep.

Here are the things I like at twenty-five – calls with my siblings and friends, photos of Yonggi, playing guitar, my fountain pen, floral wrap dresses and silk scarves, and today when my dad and I howled with laughter as the total at the gas pump came out to $37.01.

At this age, you feel so different from your younger self – you feel grown-up and sophisticated, but you’re still laughably young and maybe too confident.

It’s probably the rice wine, but I can’t help but laugh looking back on this year. All the times I’d find myself in impossibly stupid situations thinking, “I’m twenty-five! I shouldn’t be making these mistakes” seem inconsequential now. The truth is I make these mistakes because I’m still young and have so much left to learn and so much more to go. Words can’t express how immensely grateful I am to have friends and family who are willing to walk with me.

Thank you.
