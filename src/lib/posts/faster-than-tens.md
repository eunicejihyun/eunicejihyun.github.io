I quit my job without another one lined up _again._

Maybe it was because I related a little too much to this <NewTabLink text="Key & Peele sketch" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymRqYz-Mxnw" /> as an analyst.

Or maybe it was because of the relief and shame I felt from requesting to work from home once a week after having worked in person through the shutdown.

Personally, I think the turning point was opening job search sites only to pause because I had no clue what to search for. I didn’t want to be an analyst anymore, but with my skillset, I can only really be an analyst… right?

I’m not particularly good at anything else. Sales? Back in 2019, when people were interested in buying my pottery, I would dissuade them. “Save your money,” I would say. (I ended up selling my ceramic lamp for $75. It took 23 hours to make.) Programming? It once took four hours to “fix” my number guessing game.

I still haven’t applied for any jobs, and I won’t. I need to understand what’s out there before I set myself on a new career path.

If you love your job (or have ever had a job that you loved), please send me a message! I would love to chat for 5-10 minutes to get an idea of what you do and why you love it.
