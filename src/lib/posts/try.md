Last week, I was suddenly overwhelmed with feelings of inadequacy and apathy. Wanting to escape thoughts of It can’t be you, and You’re not good enough, I slept all day. I was contemplating whether to go back to sleep when a single thought fluttered by.

_What if I try?_

Despite the endless negativity that plagued my mind, I clung to that one elusive thought.

Since December, I had been preparing for the UiPath RPA certification. It’s not supposed to take that long, but I kept doubting both the value of the certification and my own ability to pass.

It was past midnight when I pushed my blankets off and walked over to my office (a small desk inside a reach-in closet with a chair in the doorway). After studying for some time, I took the final part of the exam submitting my files at 4am, and I passed.

This is hardly a feat. And I doubt I’ll ever use UiPath in a super productive way. My point is that imposter syndrome is so real, even when it comes to things that are inconsequential, but we need to get a grip on reality to understand that we are way more capable than we let ourselves believe.

From now on, I will cling to any hope that somehow finds its way to me. I will not be in my own way.
