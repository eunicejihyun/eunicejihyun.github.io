Some people seem to think that unemployment is simply <NewTabLink text="filming claymation videos" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jqKiVHS6x4" /> while listening to <NewTabLink text="Hard Times by Paramore" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEB6ibtdPZc" />. It totally can be, and that would be fine! However, I’d like to believe that, in the end, it serves as a time of rest, reflection, and exploration for most people.

When I quit my job, I was disappointed and lost. Despite learning so much and meeting such beautiful and clever minds, I never felt like I could plant myself there. In pursuit of a predefined dream, I had forgotten who I was. So I started to fill my days with everything I wanted to do.

*   See a world-class opera for 3 euros.
*   Make outer space themed pottery in a cold garage.
*   Volunteer at the humane society and pretend you didn’t cry after praying the unwanted dogs would find good homes.
*   Help people with their passion projects.
*   Read novels with Asian female protagonists (because you want to relate to the main character for once!)

In some odd way, all of these things helped me understand my skills and interests. I love connecting with and helping people. I like making things that are beautiful yet challenging and practical. I like to be inspired. I like to feel like I matter.

It’s taken a lot for me to share my thoughts publicly because I spent most of my time hiding. I didn’t want anyone to pity me or to criticize my life decisions. I’m sharing my thoughts with the hope that others who feel stuck in their life will find solace knowing they’re not alone.
