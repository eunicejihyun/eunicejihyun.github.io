Saturday night found me in a one-piece kneeling over a bathtub of soaking laundry, listening to Goodness of God, and just weeping.

It all started with the decision to do my laundry.

I haul my basket out of my apartment and over to the laundry room. After getting everything ready, I insert my card. _Error._ I try again. _Error._ I try my other card. _Error._ I unplug the machine and plug it back in again. _Error._ The sticker on the machine says I can only call Mondays through Fridays during normal business hours.

Nbd. Google Search: laundromats near me. I call the number to make sure they’re open. _Ring Ring Ring_… No one picks up. A quick web search tells me that laundromats are considered non-essential and were forced to close.

Nbd. I get a call from my parents. Mom wants to reduce her business hours. Sounds reasonable during a pandemic. She doesn’t have health insurance. She reduces it from 57.5 hours to 43 hours. I tell her that’s hardly a reduction. She says she wants to accommodate the few customers who come in before and after work. There aren’t many customers. I know she just wants to make the rent. I pretend to understand while making the sign and updating her website.

Google Search: How to hand wash laundry.

I fill the bathtub with water and some laundry detergent and dump in all my stuff. The water is hot so I put on rubber gloves. Swish swish swish. My jeans get wet from the swishing so I change into a one piece. Things are okay. I drain the water and repeat the process without detergent. This time, I step on the wet clothes like I’m stomping on grapes. Things are okay. For an hour, I try to twist the water out of my heavy, soaking laundry unsure if it’s actually clean. My arms ache. Bethany Barnard starts to sing.

All my life, you have been faithful.  
All my life, you have been so, so good.  
With every breath that I am able,  
I will sing of the goodness of God.

I start to cry. Some things are just not okay.

Don’t get me wrong. I feel so grateful that my loved ones and I are healthy. I love my new job, and the people at work are amazing and kind. Joy is ever present in my life.

But some things are just hard to accept right now.
