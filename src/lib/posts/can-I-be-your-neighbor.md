This morning, I went to a business meeting with a very important client (tbh I was very late – my bad). We like to meet in a cramped office in our pajamas (which we have affectionately dubbed our life’s uniform) and discuss business while munching on tasteless health snacks that the matriarch of our family purchases from Costco.

My client is my father, and he is one of many that I’ve had the privilege of helping.

I don’t charge for my time nor do I expect anything in return. For me, the reward has been in being witness to those almost magical moments when my clients begin to see what I see in them.

In an effort to truly understand each individual’s strengths, I like to start off by throwing aside their stats and really getting to know their story and perspective. It’s not about taking their words at face value; it’s about inspecting their stories to help them grasp why their experiences are unique and valuable.

What I do is not therapeutic wizardry (Shout out to Laura, my therapist in college, who is proficient at this art). All I do is have conversations with people, take notes, and help them create a simple resume or website with business cards. Sometimes, I take photos of their creations and set up an online shop for them.

Although I love to be silly and make people laugh offline, when I say “business meeting” or “important client”, I’m not trying to be funny. I don’t have to be paid to treat pro bono work as important work. My goodness! I want to treat my clients with the same respect as I would a paying client so that they too will see their incredible potential.
