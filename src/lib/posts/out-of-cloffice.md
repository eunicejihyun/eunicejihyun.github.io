<i align="center">♫ Something has changed within me. Something is not the same. ♫</i>

For a long time, I believed in others more than myself. It had nothing to do with their accomplishments, age, or confidence. It was just easier for me to see greatness and potential in other people.

However, at the end of January, something changed. I would look in the mirror, and see the same person, but I really liked her. When I started seeing potential in myself, I became brave! From my closet-office, I started a blog and openly shared my thoughts and stories with people whose judgment I had previously feared. Wanting a job, I also made my resume public.

I didn’t care what others thought of me. My actions were fueled by what I thought of myself. I felt light and free and happy.

To those of you who follow my blog, I wanted to let you know that I am no longer in my cloffice. Rather, I’m in the middle of nowhere, PA awaiting my first day of work. Although I’m anxious about this transition, I know that all this uneasiness is just a growing pain. I’m looking forward to this next chapter of my life and the person I will be by the end of it!
