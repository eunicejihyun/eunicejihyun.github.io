It has been nearly two months since my last post, and I feel that I can write comfortably again. I’d surmise that the few people who would check in now and then have forgotten about this blog. So I’m peeking my head back in and once again entering the room. The door isn’t locked, but I’m not calling anyone over. It’s okay to be alone for now. Here, I can do what I want. I can sing off-key and dance to Split Stones. I can paint dark paintings without feeling ashamed. I can look in the mirror and see someone who’s not wearing a mask. I can shout my thoughts into the expansive void. It makes me feel human. It makes me feel alive.
