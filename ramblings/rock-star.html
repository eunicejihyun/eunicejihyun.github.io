<article><h1>rock star</h1>
	<p>In a previous post, I mentioned going through a time of intentional personal development. Basically, it was several months of putting myself in stress-inducing situations to become the person I wanted to be (without hating myself for doing so).</p>
<p>Around that time, I attended a three-week work training where I met “Anya”. Being the incredible person she is, Anya accompanied me to a bar one Friday night because one of my goals was to sing karaoke in a public setting. She decided not to drink alcohol, and not wanting her to feel alone, I decided I wouldn’t either.</p>
<p>We ordered cola and sat down to watch a few people step into the spotlight and sing their hearts out. The night was young, and people were still fueling up on liquid courage. Feeling nervous, I contemplated abandoning my night’s only objective. She prodded me into picking out a song anyway.</p>
<p>Cue music.</p>
<p>It was immediately evident that all those years of singing in the pews taught me nothing. It took several attempts for me to find the key and with my limited range, I audibly struggled to hit the high notes.</p>
<p>However, by the second verse, I found myself truly enjoying the moment. The bartender was right. Since everyone was drinking, they didn’t care if some random person sang a Shawn Mendes song off-key. And being sober, I was able to take everything in – the fear, exhilaration, and inconsequentiality of it all.</p>
<p>As the music came to a close, I felt liberated and proud because there, in that crowd of drunken people, sat my equally sober friend clapping and hollering with a huge smile on her face.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people like Anya because they are the ones who will push you to live out even your most insignificant dreams.</p>
